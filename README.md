# Professional Unemployment Analysis (India 2019–2020)

This repository contains a reproducible Python analysis of unemployment rates in India for 2019–2020, with a focus on the COVID-19 lockdown impact, seasonal patterns, and short-term forecasting.

Contents
- `Unemployment_analysis.py` — Main analysis pipeline: data discovery, cleaning, EDA, visualizations, statistical tests, and forecasting.
- `Unemployment in India.xls`, `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.xls` — Source data files (included in the project).
- `combined_cleaned_unemployment.csv` — Combined cleaned dataset produced by the pipeline.
- Output files (generated by the script): `national_trend.png`, `rural_urban_trend.png`https://github.com/Abdulmuj33b/CodeAlpha_UnemploymentAnalysisWithPython/blob/main/rural_urban_trend.png, `seasonality.png`, `sarima_forecast.csv`, `sarima_forecast.png`, `state_level_summary.csv`, `covid_impact_summary.csv`, `lockdown_significance_test.csv`, `policy_insights.txt`.

Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (tested in a venv)
- See `requirements.txt` for the Python package list.

Quick setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the analysis
1. Place any new unemployment data files (CSV/XLS/XLSX) in the project directory. The script auto-discovers files with names containing "unemployment".
2. Run the pipeline:

```bash
python Unemployment_analysis.py
```

Outputs
- The pipeline writes cleaned and aggregated CSVs, figures, a forecasting CSV and figure, and a short policy insights report. The combined cleaned dataset is saved as `combined_cleaned_unemployment.csv`.

Notes on forecasting
- The pipeline attempts forecasting using a seasonal SARIMA model. It includes robust fallbacks: non-seasonal ARIMA and a simple AR(1) estimated by OLS. If monthly indices are irregular, the script normalizes them to monthly start dates and will attempt quarterly aggregation when appropriate.
- If forecasts look unstable (large/explosive values), try increasing sample length, aggregating to a lower frequency (quarterly), or adjusting SARIMA orders.

Reproducibility
- The script is deterministic given the same input files. To reproduce results on another machine, copy the project, install the requirements, and run `Unemployment_analysis.py`.
